## üî• Multi-dimensional Hybrid Parallel with Vision Transformer
1. Go to **hybrid_parallel** folder in the **tutorial** directory.
2. Install our model zoo.
```bash
pip install titans
```
3. Run with synthetic data which is of similar shape to CIFAR10 with the `-s` flag.
```bash
colossalai run --nproc_per_node 4 train.py --config config.py -s
```

4. Modify the config file to play with different types of tensor parallelism, for example, change tensor parallel size to be 4 and mode to be 2d and run on 8 GPUs.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Sequence Parallel with BERT
1. Go to the **sequence_parallel** folder in the **tutorial** directory.
2. Run with the following command
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
colossalai run --nproc_per_node 4 train.py -s
```
3. The default config is sequence parallel size = 2, pipeline size = 1, let‚Äôs change pipeline size to be 2 and try it again.

## üìï Large batch optimization with LARS and LAMB
1. Go to the **large_batch_optimizer**  folder in the **tutorial** directory.
2. Run with synthetic data
```bash
colossalai run --nproc_per_node 4 train.py --config config.py -s
```

## üòÄ Auto-Parallel Tutorial
1. Go to the  **auto_parallel** folder in the **tutorial** directory.
2. Install `pulp` and `coin-or-cbc` for the solver.
```bash
pip install pulp
conda install -c conda-forge coin-or-cbc
```
2. Run the auto parallel resnet example with 4 GPUs with synthetic dataset.
```bash
colossalai run --nproc_per_node 4 auto_parallel_with_resnet.py -s
```

You should expect to the log like this. This log shows the edge cost on the computation graph as well as the sharding strategy for an operation. For example, `layer1_0_conv1 S01R = S01R X RR` means that the first dimension (batch) of the input and output is sharded while the weight is not sharded (S means sharded, R means replicated), simply equivalent to data parallel training.

## üéÜ Auto-Checkpoint Tutorial
1. Stay in the `auto_parallel` folder.
2. Install the dependencies.
```bash
pip install matplotlib transformers
```
3. Run a simple resnet50 benchmark to automatically checkpoint the model.
```bash
python auto_ckpt_solver_test.py --model resnet50
```

You should expect the log to be like this

This shows that given different memory budgets, the model is automatically injected with activation checkpoint and its time taken per iteration. You can run this benchmark for GPT as well but it can much longer since the model is larger.
```bash
python auto_ckpt_solver_test.py --model gpt2
```

4. Run a simple benchmark to find the optimal batch size for checkpointed model.
```bash
python auto_ckpt_batchsize_test.py
```

You can expect the log to be like

## üöÄ Run OPT finetuning and inference
1. Install the dependency
```bash
pip install datasets accelerate
```
2. Run finetuning with synthetic datasets with one GPU
```bash
bash ./run_clm_synthetic.sh
```
3. Run finetuning with 4 GPUs
```bash
bash ./run_clm_synthetic.sh 16 0 125m 4
```
4. Run inference with OPT 125M
```bash
docker hpcaitech/tutorial:opt-inference
docker run -it --rm --gpus all --ipc host -p 7070:7070 hpcaitech/tutorial:opt-inference
```
5. Start the http server inside the docker container with tensor parallel size 2
```bash
python opt_fastapi.py opt-125m --tp 2 --checkpoint /data/opt-125m
```
