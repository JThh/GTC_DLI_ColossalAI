# GTC-DLI Tutorial for ColossalAI

For detailed instructions and self-contained notebook to run the ColossalAI examples, refer to the `tutorial` folder.

## Introduction

Welcome to the [Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI) tutorial, which has been accepted as official tutorials by top conference [SC](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/), [AAAI](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-23/), [PPoPP](https://ppopp23.sigplan.org/), etc.


[Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI), a unified deep learning system for the big model era, integrates
many advanced technologies such as multi-dimensional tensor parallelism, sequence parallelism, heterogeneous memory management,
large-scale optimization, adaptive task scheduling, etc. By using Colossal-AI, we could help users to efficiently and
quickly deploy large AI model training and inference, reducing large AI model training budgets and scaling down the labor cost of learning and deployment.
